## How to Use These Documents

1. **Start with the Articulation** if you want a clean, clear explanation of the design
2. **Read the Review** if you want an honest assessment of strengths and weaknesses
3. **Study the Platform Vision** if you want to understand the unified vision of Engine + Toolkit
4. **Reference the Architecture** if you want technical details about how the proof-of-concept supports the design

## Key Concepts

- **Character Issuance**: Players don't build characters; they are issued complete, immutable goblins
- **Axis-Based Resolution**: Actions are resolved through multiple axes (Timing, Precision, Stability, etc.), not single dice rolls
- **Ledger and Narrative**: Hard truth (ledger) vs. soft truth (newspaper interpretation)
- **Creator's Toolkit**: Players use the same tools as developers to create content
- **Tinkering**: The game invites players to modify, extend, and create within the system

## The Vision in One Sentence

**The Undertaking is a procedural accountability system where players are issued flawed goblins, their failures are recorded as data, and they eventually earn the right to use the same tools as the developers to build their own worlds.**
